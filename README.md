## About
The purpose of this project is to create an interface for accessing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This interface will allow users to select different data sets, combine them, and obtain subdatasets from them. This interface would be an easier alternative for accessing the NHANES data than the current method of directly accessing it.
