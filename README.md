## About
The purpose of this project is to create an interface for accessing data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). This interface will allow users to select different data sets, combine them, and obtain subdatasets from them. This interface would be an easier alternative for accessing the NHANES data than the current method of directly accessing it.

Program upkeep information such as how we do automation, testing, and documentation can be found under [Docs/Info/](./Docs/Info). This also contains a cost analysis that compares the costs and capabilities of using AWS and ShinyApps IO server hosting.

A guide for how to setup and maintain an AWS server can be found under [Docs/AWS Setup Guide/]("./Docs/AWS Setup Guide/"). This also contains a guide for how to setup the project on a ShinyApps IO server.

Documentation on the project's progress over time is located under [Docs/Previous TPS Reports]("./Docs/Previous TPS Reports").
