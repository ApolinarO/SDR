# R Data Project - Automation
Automation will involve the use of a bash script through a Makefile several R Scripts. Through the use of the bash command _RScript_, it is possible to run R scripts from bash.

Running "make run_tests" from bash runs the followning command on the terminal: 

	Rscript tests.R

This would then run an R file that would contain all of the unit tests to run.

More information on how we will implement automation into our program can be found alongside our [Automation Spikes](../Spikes/Automation%20Spikes).
